# X-client
Hi and welcome, this is a web-based client interface - a fun project I'm building to help me expand my understanding of vue and reactivity. 

# Setup
- use `source ./setup` to add `.bin/xclient` to `$PATH` then you can call `xclient` cli

- jump into pkgs/frontend and play around with configs in `conf` then `yarn install` and `yarn run dev --host`

- dev service should be available on `localhost:5137` or through your local ip address

- optionally enable `dev_mode` by calling `toggle_debug()` in your browser console
